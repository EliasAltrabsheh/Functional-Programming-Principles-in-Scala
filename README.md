# Functional Programming Principles in Scala

The priciple assignment course is the first course of the specilization  "Functional Programming in scala specialization". 

This Specialization provides a hands-on introduction to functional programming using the widespread programming language, Scala. 
It begins from the basic building blocks of the functional paradigm, first showing how to use these blocks to solve small problems, before building up to combining these concepts to architect larger functional programs. 
Functional paradigm facilitates parallel and distributed programming, and through a series of hands on examples and programming assignments, you'll learn how to analyze data sets small to large; from parallel programming on multicore architectures, to distributed programming on a cluster using Apache Spark.

A final capstone project will allow you to apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data.



Functional Programming Principles in Scala syllabus is broken down by :

1) Week 1 : Get up and running with Scala.  The difference between functional imperative programming will be explored; covering expressions, evaluation, conditionals, functions, and recursion

2) Week 2 : Functions as first-class values, and higher order functions.Scala's syntax and how it's formally defined. Finally,  classes, and data abstraction through the design of a data structure for rational numbers are covered.

3) Week 3 : This week, we'll cover traits, and we'll learn how to organize classes into hierarchies. We'll cover the hierarchy of standard Scala types, and see how to organize classes and traits into packages. Finally, we'll touch upon the different sorts of polymorphism in Scala.

4) Week 4 : This week we'll learn about the relationship between functions and objects in Scala; functions *are* objects! We'll zoom in on Scala's type system, covering subtyping and generics, and moving on to more advanced aspects of Scala's type system like variance. Finally, we'll cover Scala's most widely used data structure, Lists, and one of Scala's most powerful tools, pattern matching.

5) Week 5 : This week we dive into Lists, the most commonly-used data structure in Scala.

6) Week 6 : After a deep-dive into Lists, this week we'll explore other data structures; vectors, maps, ranges, arrays, and more. We'll dive into Scala's powerful and flexible for-comprehensions for querying data.


Assignment deatails are broken down in each week's folder.
